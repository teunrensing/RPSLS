## 📖 Overview
This project, **rpsls_ml_dl**, is about recognizing hand signs from the extended version of the classic game **Rock–Paper–Scissors**, known as **Rock–Paper–Scissors–Lizard–Spock (RPSLS)**.  

The project uses **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques to classify hand gestures into one of the five signs:
- ✊ Rock  
- ✋ Paper  
- ✌️ Scissors  
- 🤏 Lizard  
- 🖖 Spock  

The signs come from the famous TV show *The Big Bang Theory*, where Sheldon introduced the game as a fun twist on the original.

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Build an image classification model to recognize hand signs.  
- Explore **ML approaches** 
- Explore **DL approaches**  
- Train on custom or open datasets of hand signs.
